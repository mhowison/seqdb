Overview
--------

SeqDB is a file format, compressor and storage tool for the raw data produced
by Next-Generation Sequencing platforms like the Illumina Genome Analyzer,
Illumina HiSeq 2000, or AB SOLiD 4.

SeqDB offers high-throughput compression of sequence data with similar
compression ratios to gzip.  It achieves this by combining the existing
multi-threaded BLOSC compressor with a new data-parallel byte-packing scheme,
called SeqPack, which interleaves sequence data and quality scores.

We have a paper under review with IEEE TCBB.
