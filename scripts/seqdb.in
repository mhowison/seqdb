This is a wrapper script for the various components that come
with SeqDB, a high-throughput storage solution for Next-Generation Sequencing
data. The following commands are available:

  help       Print this help message
  version    Print the version
  cite       Print information on citing SeqDB

  info       Print a summary of a SeqDB file
  profile    Print a histogram of ID and sequence lengths for a FASTQ file
  compress   Create a SeqDB file from a FASTQ file
  extract    Output a SeqDB file in FASTQ format
  mount      Create a special file containing a SeqDB file in FASTQ format
  unmount    Remove a previously mounted SeqDB file

To print a help message for a specific command, use either:
  seqdb help COMMAND
  seqdb COMMAND -h
"
	exit 0
}

seqdb-cite() {
	echo "
Please cite SeqDB as:

[publication under review]
"
	exit 0

seqdb-version() {
	echo "SeqDB @PACKAGE_VERSION@"
	exit 0
}
