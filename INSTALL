SeqDB Installation
==================

We plan to add binary packages for Debian/Ubuntu and RedHat/CentOS soon,
and to make a Homebrew script for OS X. In the meantime, these instructions
will help you build the package from source.

Prerequisites
-------------

We have only tested SeqDB on Mac OS X 10.7 and CentOS 5.4, but we have made an
effort to stick to portable/POSIX standards and believe it will work on
most flavors of UNIX.

You will need a recent (>= 1.8) version of the HDF5 library as well as a
C++ compiler like g++ (we recommend >= 4.4).

If your HDF5 library is installed through a package manager (like rpm/yum on
RedHat or apt-get on Debian) you may also need to install the corresponding
-dev or -devel package, which will provide the HDF5 header files.


Installing from the tar ball
----------------------------

These instructions assume you are installing to the default location
(/usr/local) which may require root access. Alternative instructions for
installing to you home directory are available in the next section.

Download the latest tarball from:

 https://github.com/mhowison/seqdb/downloads

Unpack the tarball:

 tar xf seqdb-X.X.X.tar.gz
 cd seqdb-X.X.X

Run the configure script:

 ./configure

Alternatively, if your HDF5 library is installed in a non-standard location,
you will need to specify the full path to it:

 ./configure --with-hdf5=<path/to/hdf5>

Build the executables with:

 make

Then install using sudo:

 sudo make install

Try running the 'seqdb' wrapper script to print a help message:

 seqdb help

Follow the TUTORIAL to test out your installation.


Installing to your home directory
---------------------------------

To install to an alternative location, like your home directory, use the
--prefix option when configuring:

 ./configure --prefix=$HOME

If you haven't already added your $HOME/bin directory to your path, you will
need to do this in one of your initialization scripts. For bash, you could do:

 echo "export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH" >>~/.bashrc
 source ~/.bashrc

Now the seqdb wrapper and executables should be in your path.
