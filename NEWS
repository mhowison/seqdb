0.2.0
=====

* Fixed a bug in SeqPack where variable-length sequences were not stored
  correctly.
* When reading a SeqDB file, the SeqPack tables stored in the file itself are
  now used. This will prevent future changes to the default tables from
  breaking backward compatability with existing SeqDB files. FUTURE VERSIONS
  MAY NOT SUPPORT SEQDB 0.1.X FILES!
* Upgraded to Blosc 1.1.5. Modified Blosc to use thread pinning on Linux.
* Added a very basic C API for adding native SeqDB calls to C codes (e.g.
  velveth). You must link the C program against libseqdb with the C++ compiler.
* Added an option to seqdb-extract to extract a single record.
* seqdb-profile now displays a histogram of quality scores.
* Added pkgconfig support.
* FASTQ and SeqDB are now pure virtual classes.

0.1.1
=====

* Added a new C++ mount tool (seqdb-mount) to replace the earlier bash script.
